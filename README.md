FlashAccelerometer
=============

This is a quick example showing how to access the Accelerometer in HTML.
For devices that support the HTML API they access it directly (iOS 4.2+ and PlayBook)
but for other devices such as Android phones we have a SWF that feed it the values via
an ExternalInterface bridge.
